## Scheduling Algorithms

1. First Come First Served
   - sequential execution of processes no matter their burst times
2. Shortest Job First
   - the process with shortest burst time gets executed first
3. Priority Scheduling
   - the process with highest priority (starts at 1) gets executed
     first no matter the burst times of the processes or time the
     processes came in
